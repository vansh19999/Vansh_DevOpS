# This manifest defines a headless Service for MySQL in Kubernetes.
# Headless Services provide stable DNS records for each pod, useful for StatefulSets.

apiVersion: v1                # Specifies the API version for the Service resource.
kind: Service                 # Declares the type of resource as Service.
metadata:
  name: mysql                 # The name assigned to this Service.
  namespace: stateful-lab     # The namespace where this Service will be created.
  labels:
    app: mysql                # Labels used to organize and select resources.
spec:
  clusterIP: None             # Makes the Service headless; no cluster IP is assigned.
  selector:
    app: mysql                # Selects pods with the label 'app: mysql'.
  ports:
    - name: mysql             # Name of the port (for reference).
      port: 3306              # Port exposed by the Service.
      targetPort: 3306        # Port on the pod that the Service forwards to.
